HEELLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

This small project is purely for private use, and to show to possible employers I can do some stuff.
You can do whatever you would like with this code I have made, go nuts(though don't do anything illegal)

Honestly no idea what to put here, a lot of stuff I put in the comments in ___main___.py, so not much left to say here
There is a lot more functionality to add, but just wanted something to show to employers, instead of literally nothing
Have a nice day I guess <3
